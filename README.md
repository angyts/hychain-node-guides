1. [Buy node keys](#buy-node-keys).
2. [Decide on whether you want to use Nodeops](#using-nodeops), or
3. [You want to run your own nodes at home](#running-your-own-nodes), or
4. With a server "in a cloud" (public cloud service / virtual private cloud).
5. [Get some Hychain $TOPIA](#get-topia).
6. [Delegate your node keys](#delegate-your-node-keys).
7. [Grab a cup of coffee, and profit](#how-to-claim-rewards).
8. [Oh no I got stuck somewhere](#i-got-stuck).

### Buy node keys

Make sure you have some ETH on Ethereum mainnet, go to the [official site](https://nodes.hychain.com/) and purchase them.

---
### Using Nodeops
TODO
---
### Running your own nodes
1. Check out the [requirements](https://docs.hychain.com/docs/what-are-node-hardware-requirements), and prepare the machine properly first.
2. Setting up the machine, and choosing an operating system.
3. Hardening the machine. (TODO a guide on this)
4. Setup the node according to the operating system of your node. [Click here for Linux servers](#setup-for-linux-servers). Click here for ARM servers (like raspberry pi). [Click here for windows servers](#setup-for-Windows-servers). Click here for Mac servers.

--- 

### Setup for Linux servers

1. Login to your server. Recommend to [learn SSH](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ssh-command-in-linux-with-examples/) and login with SSH.
2. Create a non root user. For example for the user `hychain-node-user`.

```bash
sudo adduser --system --group hychain-node-user
```

3. Download the latest release

```bash
sudo wget https://github.com/HYCHAIN/guardian-node-software/releases/download/0.0.1/guardian-cli-linux-v0.0.1.zip -O /home/hychain-node-user/node.zip
```

4. Download the software to unzip it. (Dear devs, please consider using tar instead)

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install unzip
```

5. Unzip the file and cleanup

```bash
sudo unzip -o /home/hychain-node-user/node.zip -d /home/hychain-node-user/
sudo rm /home/hychain-node-user/node.zip
```

6. Create a new wallet

```bash
sudo /home/hychain-node-user/guardian-cli-linux guardian new-wallet
```

| :exclamation:  Please save the public and private key somewhere safe!!!   |
|-----------------------------------------|

7. [Delegate your node keys](#delegate-your-node-keys), using this public address.

8. Test to see if it works, insert your private key into `<private key from the new-wallet command above>`.

```bash
sudo /home/hychain-node-user/guardian-cli-linux guardian run <private key from the new-wallet command above> --loop-interval-ms 3600000
```

You should see the following output or something similar if it works.

`$Apr 02 21:08:52 hyserver bash[5649]: [21:08:52.042] INFO: Running guardian for owner (0x22134145124151511511455145144125) with 99999999999 delegated node keys`<br>
`$Apr 02 21:08:53 hyserver bash[5649]: [21:08:53.502] INFO: Processing challenges for 99999999999 node keys`<br>
`$Apr 02 21:10:19 hyserver bash[5649]: [21:10:19.172] INFO: Sleeping for 3600000ms before running guardian again`<br>

At that point you can press `ctrl-c` to stop the command. If you didn't get this, you need to go through the steps and see where you missed out.

9. Use systemctl to create a long standing service.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/hychain-node.service
```

| ðŸ““:   Note: If you meet an error, maybe your linux doesn't have `nano`, you can install it with `sudo apt-get install nano`  |
|-----------------------------------------|

Paste this inside. Remember to paste your real `private key` into the `<private key from the new-wallet command above>`.

```nano
[Unit]
Description=Hychain Node
Documentation=https://github.com/angyts/hychain-node-guides/blob/main/README.md#setup-for-linux-servers

[Service]
Type=simple
User=hychain-node-user
Group=hychain-node-user
WorkingDirectory=/home/hychain-node-user/
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c './guardian-cli-linux guardian run <private key from the new-wallet command above> --loop-interval-ms 3600000'
Restart=always
RestartSec=3

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
RequiredBy=network.target
```

Then click `ctrl-x` to save changes.

Start the service with

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start hychain-node.service
```

You can check on the status of the service with

```bash
sudo systemctl status hychain-node.service
```

or this command to view the logs.

```bash
sudo journalctl -fu hychain-node | ccze
```

If you want to stop it, use

```bash
sudo systemctl stop hychain-node.service
```

Now it will run even when your server restarts. But be careful of sharing your log files, because your private key might be there.

### Setup for Windows servers

1. Create a folder to keep the file. Maybe like in the documents.
2. Download [this file](https://github.com/HYCHAIN/guardian-node-software/releases/download/0.0.1/guardian-cli-windows-v0.0.1.zip). https://github.com/HYCHAIN/guardian-node-software/releases/download/0.0.1/guardian-cli-windows-v0.0.1.zip
3. Extract this file and move it inside the folder that you just created.
4. Look for this file `guardian-cli-win.exe`. Right click on it, and click `properties`. Look for this thing called `location`. It might look something like `C:\Users\Documents\hychainnode`. Copy this `location`.
5. Open the command prompt with `Windows-R` to open this run window, then type `cmd` inside.
6. Go to the directory which contains your file, using `cd` then the `location` from above.

```cmd
cd <insert the location you got from above>
```

7. Create a new wallet

```cmd
guardian-cli-win guardian new-wallet
```

| :exclamation:  Please save the public and private key somewhere safe!!!   |
|-----------------------------------------|
 
8. [Delegate your node keys](#delegate-your-node-keys), using this public address.

9. Run the node once to see if it works. Insert your `private key` into `<private key from the new-wallet>`

```cmd
guardian-cli-win.exe guardian run <private key from the new-wallet> --loop-interval-ms 3600000
```

You should see the following output or something similar if it works.

`$Apr 02 21:08:52 hyserver bash[5649]: [21:08:52.042] INFO: Running guardian for owner (0x22134145124151511511455145144125) with 99999999999 delegated node keys`<br>
`$Apr 02 21:08:53 hyserver bash[5649]: [21:08:53.502] INFO: Processing challenges for 99999999999 node keys`<br>
`$Apr 02 21:10:19 hyserver bash[5649]: [21:10:19.172] INFO: Sleeping for 3600000ms before running guardian again`<br>

At that point you can press `ctrl-c` to stop the command. If you didn't get this, you need to go through the steps and see where you missed out.

10. Use `Task Scheduler` to make a long running process.
 1. Open Start
 2. Type `Task Scheduler` and open.
 3. Right click `Task Scheduler Library` and click `New Folder`, maybe name it `Hychain Node`. Select the new folder you created.
 4. Click Action > Create Basic Task
 5. Put the following settings. Before pasting it, replace the `<your folder location above>` with your `location` above. Watch out for the slashes, and make sure that the whole thing is a valid file location. Also replace the `<private key from the new-wallet>` with your `private key`. Then click finish.

### Setup for MacOS servers

create a folder
https://github.com/HYCHAIN/guardian-node-software/releases download macos zip and move it inside the folder you created
unzip/extract the zip wile and click on the folder until you see guardian-cli-macos.exe
right click and choose open terminal
./guardian-cli-macos guardian new-wallet (write public and secret keys somewhere)
https://delegate.xyz/?r&chainId=2911&contract=0xE1060b30D9fF01Eef71248906Ce802801a670A48
fill in the public wallet you got in new-wallet command and connect metamask (you will need some topia on hychain and not on eth)
and after that  ./guardian-cli-macos guardian run <private key from the new-wallet> --loop-interval-ms 3600000

 If you are having issues with terminal just closing and you can't do anything follow this additional step
go into your system settings and check under "Privacy & Security" if it says "App ... was blocked from use"?
click allow anyway and try running command again 

---

### Get TOPIA
1. Have some $MATIC on Polygon Mainnet (Chain ID:137). Go to any decentralised exchange. Let's use uniswap as an example. https://app.uniswap.org/. Don't google, learn to type it directly in the browser.
2. Look for the NFT WORLD $WRLD token contract address. `0xD5d86FC8d5C0Ea1aC1Ac5Dfab6E529c9967a45E9` Convince yourself and make sure it really is the correct token.
3. Key `0xD5d86FC8d5C0Ea1aC1Ac5Dfab6E529c9967a45E9` into the `Search name or paste address`

4. Swap some $MATIC into $WRLD
5. Go to the [bridge](https://bridge.hytopia.com/bridge). https://bridge.hytopia.com/bridge
6. Then bridge your $WRLD into $TOPIA on Hychain.
7. While you are at it, add Hychain mainnet to your metamask by clicking the button below.

### Delegate your node keys
1) Firstly you need some $TOPIA on the Hychain, [see above](#get-topia).
2) Go to [delegate.xyx](https://delegate.xyz/?r&chainId=2911&contract=0xE1060b30D9fF01Eef71248906Ce802801a670A48). https://delegate.xyz/?r&chainId=2911&contract=0xE1060b30D9fF01Eef71248906Ce802801a670A48
3) Connect with the wallet that your bought your `node keys` on.
4) Confirm that you are on Hychain and the contract is `0xE1060b30D9fF01Eef71248906Ce802801a670A48`.
5) Key in your `public address` from above in the box and commit the transaction on chain. I think it uses about 0.4 $TOPIA.
